# REMAILMINDER

## Project Idea:
This allows you to input an email address and the title of something you need to remember and it will send you a reminder via email the day that you have been specified. It is a very easy and useful way to remind yourself of something. I have been using it for a couple of months and have been very happy with it. It is simple, does not require a lot of work, and is easy to set up and use.
I hope that using this website, can help you  in your school life and other life activities.
If you have any other suggestions, please let me know.
Thanks.
